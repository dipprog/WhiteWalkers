<b>AIM</b>
To design a video game with below mentioned theme and specific parameters.

<b>Need of the work</b></br>
This video game is required to design a study on human visuospatial working memory. We hypothesize that playing the video game based on later-mentioned specific parameters will train and effectively improve the performance of visuospatial components of working memory. There are few psychological test batteries which have these parameters implemented as a training module as well as test batteries. But we assume that presenting these training parameters in the form of video game will more interesting, interactive and then more effective for improving oneâ€™s working memory.

<b>Parameters to be included in the video game: </b></br>
Our motive is to design a game/games with different module for provide specific cognitive training in video game environments.
These modules are:

1. Visual search (VS)

2. Mental rotation (MR)

3. Spatial navigation (SN)

4. Visual puzzle (VP)
